        The movie <b><i>Cars</i></b> is my favorite movie for multiple reasons. It was my favorite movie as a kid and it is still one of my favorites. It's very interesting because of the racing and the story line. I thought it was a very nice movie that people will watch for a long time, kids and adults. I wouldn't have thought a movie about talking cars would be so good but I was wrong. From the racing and action to the little jokes life there isn't a moment that I didn't enjoy.
